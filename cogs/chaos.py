If you do, you'll be able to roll on items with others who have at least 70% attendance as well. That means that if you drop below that, you lose the privilege to roll on loot unless there is no one else who wants the item. This also means that new recruits will first have to "prove" themselves by attending regularly before they're eligible for loot. Assuming they can attend both raids every week, they'll have to wait 4 lockouts before they can roll with the rest of us. Type !attendance help for more information."""

RCLootCouncil: <https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/rclootcouncil>
